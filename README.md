Rock Paper Scissors game built using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

I practiced and used Git branching in this project when I needed add the UI to the game to separate the code as it was just a console game at first.

I also made it responsive for mobile using media queries.

- Play against the computer
- Outline of circle changes color depending on if you win, lose or tie the round.
- Restart button to reset score back to 0.
- View score after each round.
- Mobile responsive.
